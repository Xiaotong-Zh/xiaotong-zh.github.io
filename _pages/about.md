I am currently a Ph.D. candidate and research assistant at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/) advised by Professor [Kamal Youcef-Toumi](https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/YOUCEF@MIT.EDU). My research goal and vision are to enable fast and safe Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) in dynamic and unpredictable environments. I am passionate about developing novel and effective methodologies in the full-stack robotics pipeline to enable this goal from perception, planning, to mechatronics. Please stay tuned about this new challenge in my research journey. 

Before my PhD research, my diverse and multi-disciplinary research background enables me to generate ideas inspired by multiple domains. During my master, I worked on developing the first-ever [Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) energy harvester to power hard-to-reach wireless sensor networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9761889). This work was selected as the 2023 Best Transaction Paper Award for IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics. During my undergrad research, I worked intensively on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for complex hydrodynamics phenomena, which was awarded as the top 1% undergraduate thesis from [SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).
