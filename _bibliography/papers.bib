  abstract = {Precision mechatronics and nanotechnology communities can both benefit from a course centered around an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). Developing an AFM can provide precision mechatronics engineers with a valuable multidisciplinary hands-on training experience. In return, such expertise can be applied to the design and implementation of new precision instruments, which helps nanotechnology researchers make new scientific discoveries. However, existing AFMs are not suitable for mechatronics education due to their different original design intentions. Therefore, we address this challenge by developing an AFM intended for precision mechatronics education.This paper presents the design and implementation of an educational AFM and its corresponding precision mechatronics class. The modular educational AFM is low-cost (4,000) and easy to operate. The cost reduction is enabled by new subsystem development of a buzzer-actuated scanner and demodulation electronics designed to interface with a myRIO data acquisition system. Moreover, the use of an active cantilever probe with piezoresistive sensing and thermomechanical actuation significantly reduced experiment setup overhead with improved operational safety. In the end, the developed AFM capabilities are demonstrated with imaging results. The paper also showcases the course design centered around selected subsystems. The new AFM design allows scientific-method-based learning, maximizes utilization of existing resources, and offers potential subsystem upgrades for high-end research applications. The presented instrument and course can help connect members of both the AFM and the mechatronics communities to further develop advanced techniques for new applications.},

  abstract = {In this thesis, an innovative Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) energy harvester with the use of the magnetic concentrator is designed and optimized. A theoretical model relating the conductivity of water, magnetic flux density B, flow velocity u and the channel volume to the power output is first established. This leads to the decoupled analysis and simulations of magnetic field and flow field. The prototyped energy harvester without the concentrator achieves a power output of 442 nW, while the power output of the final design with the concentrator is expected to be 718.5 nW. The concept of another MHD energy harvester with a spiral flow diverter is also established with hollow space in the middle of the energy harvester for flow and robots to pass through. It is validated by CFD simulations that the flow velocity in the channel surrounding the hollow area is greatly amplified with the spiral flow diverter. The MHD energy harvester with the concentrators and spiral flow divereter is expected to produce power output of 238.3 nW.},

  abstract = {Smart pipes can be adopted as a solution to problems in water distribution systems. However, the real application of such a system is usually constrained by power delivery. In this article, a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) energy harvester for low-power pipe instrumentation is developed. A theoretical model of the maximum power output containing parameters of water conductivity, flow velocity, magnetic flux density, and water channel volume is derived. To enhance the magnetic flux density, a magnetic concentrator is designed and carefully tuned to arrange the magnetic flux as we desire and magnify the magnetic flux density within the channels. A spiral flow diverter is proposed to reconfigure the original pipe flow pattern and divert the flow into the surrounding channels to enhance the flow velocity. After integrating the proposed improvements from different fields and globally optimizing the power output, a final design is prototyped and tested in the lab, which achieves a maximum power output of 87.47 nW with a 2-m/s pipe inlet velocity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MHD energy harvester for low-power sensor networks. Its great potential is demonstrated, and several potential enhancements to the power output are proposed and analyzed.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on problems associated with the deployment of automatic agents for last-mile delivery. We propose a framework and methodology to systematically evaluate and compare different hybrid strategies. Performance metrics in agent noise, delivery time, energy consumption, coverage rate, package throughput, and system costs are defined rigorously and modeled mathematically. Using the methodology, we conduct a case study in the city of Boston for four agent delivery strategies, including a hybrid strategy proposed in this paper. The proposed strategy utilizes available space in public transits' cabins during off-peak hours to relocate the agent traveling start locations. Simulations and analyses show that hybrid strategies outperform the Agent-Only delivery strategy in terms of noise exposure, energy consumption, and coverage rate. The performance of hybrid strategies highly depends on the characteristics of the ground transportation methods accompanying agents. Thus, the methods of ground transportation should carefully be examined and selected for each case and strategy in real-world applications.},

  abstract = {Perception plays a pivotal role in enhancing the
functionality of autonomous agents. However, the intricate
relationship between robotic perception metrics and actuation
metrics remains unclear, leading to ambiguity in the development
and fine-tuning of perception algorithms. In this paper, we
introduce a methodology for quantifying this relationship, taking
into account factors such as detection rate, detection quality,
and latency. Furthermore, we introduce two novel perception
metrics for Human-Robot Collaboration safety predicated upon
basic perception metrics: Critical Collision Probability (CCP)
and Average Collision Probability (ACP). To validate the utility
of these metrics in facilitating algorithm development and
tuning, we develop an attentive processing strategy that focuses
exclusively on key input features. This approach significantly
reduces computational time while preserving a similar level of
accuracy. Experimental findings demonstrate that integrating
this strategy into an object detector results in a notable
maximum reduction of 30.09\% in inference time and 26.53\%
in total time per frame. Additionally, the strategy lowers the
CCP and ACP in a baseline model by 11.25\% and 13.50\%,
respectively.},

  abstract = {Human motion prediction is an essential step for efficient and safe human-robot collaboration. Current methods either purely rely on representing the human joints in some form of neural network-based architecture or use regression models offline to fit hyper-parameters in the hope of capturing a model encompassing human motion. While these methods provide good initial results, they are missing out on leveraging well-studied human body kinematic models as well as body and scene constraints which can help boost the efficacy of these prediction frameworks while also explicitly avoiding implausible human joint configurations. We propose a novel human motion prediction framework that incorporates human joint constraints and scene constraints in a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model to predict human motion over a set time horizon. This formulation is combined with an online context-aware constraints model to leverage task-dependent motions. It is tested on a human arm kinematic model and implemented on a human-robot collaborative setup with a UR5 robot arm to demonstrate the real-time capability of our approach. Simulations were also performed on datasets like HA4M and ANDY. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate considerable improvements in a Gaussian Process framework when these constraints are explicitly considered.},
